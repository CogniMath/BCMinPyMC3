# BCMinPyMC3
Some Python/PyMC3 model implementations of *Bayesian Cognitive Modeling: A Practical Course*, written by Michael D. Lee and Eric-Jan Wagenmakers.
See www.bayesmodels.com for the book, including some free chapters and all examples in BUGS, JAGS, and Stan.

This repository is an attempt to replicate the models in PyMC3.
